# LM-applet-quickstart

This repository contains an example setup for a [LM](https://github.com/LaunchMenu/LaunchMenu) applet. Clone this repository and get started on your applet!

Take these 5 easy steps to make your applet:

1. Copy the contents of this repository to your own repository
2. Install and run the hello-world content
3. Create your own amazing applet
4. Replace the information in the package by your own info
5. Publish the applet to npm (unfortunately there is no automatic way to install applets as of yet in LM though)

This quickstart will probably be improved in the future, with some additional tooling modules that will be released in the LaunchMenu namespace. But for how this quickstart should be sufficient to create some custom applet already.

## Developing the application

First install all dependencies by executing one of the following commands in the root:

```
yarn
```

```
npm install
```

Then start the development process by calling one of the following commands in the root:

```

Check the tray to open the program
